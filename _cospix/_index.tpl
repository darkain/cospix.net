			Welcome to the #Prometheus tech demo. This web site is a brand new
			experimental visual interface for Cospix. Please feel free to try
			it out and browse around. While doing so, however, please note that
			many pages have yet to be converted from their classic interfaces
			to their new modern #Prometheus interfaces. Additionally, certain
			features of the web site are intentionally either hidden or disabled
			while they are being updated and stabilized using this new
			interface.
		</p>

		<p style="padding:1em;font-size:3em">
			The ultimate goal of #Prometheus is to create a single unified web
			interface for Cospix that will work on Desktops, Laptops, Tablets,
			and Smart Phones. This interface includes support for both popular
			web browsers (Opera, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and Internet
			Explorer) as well as support for Android and iOS apps. Support for
			each will be rolled out in phases in the order listed above.
		</p>

		<p style="padding:1em;font-size:3em">
			Updates and bug fixes are being pushed regularly, often multiple
			times a day, so please remember to check back often for the latest
			and greatest that Cospix #Prometheus has to offer!
